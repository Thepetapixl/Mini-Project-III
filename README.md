# Mini-Project-III

## Project on Smart Parking System 

### Problem Statement:

A vehicle parking system that helps drivers find a vacant spot. Using sensors in each parking space that detect the presence or absence of a vehicle, signs direct incoming drivers to available locations. 

### Abstract: 

This paper aims to present an intelligent system for parking space detection based on image processing technique that capture and process the brown rounded image drawn at parking lot and produce the information of the empty car parking spaces. This proposed system, has been developed using IoT and Artificial intelligence.

### Literature Survey: Few Applications based on Car Parking.

1. PARKER: Find available parking

A good application for the ones who travel frequently.
It has got no rules and maps for local streets.
Only mapping techniques are good.
Gives the additional information like Price and Operating hours as well.


2. PARKWHIZ:

A very efficient application with payment details as well.
Implemented in New York, reviews were great.
But cannot be implemented in India dur to lack of space and middle mans.

### Softwares which are going to be used are as follows

- Ardunio IDE
- Visual Code Studio
- Jupyter notebook 

### Hardware Used 
 - ATmega2560 Arduino (Microcontroller)
 - LEDs
 - IR Sensor
 - Ultrasonic Sensor
 - Jumper Wires
 - USB A to B
 
### Statistics
 - Numpy
 - Pandas
 - Machine Learning
 
 
### Conclusion: 
 
The proposed framework gives an alternative way to traditional parking management system, to deal with identification of opportunities of parking spots. 
This approach comprises of distinguishing empty parking spots. The framework likewise gives drivers' information assistance. 
This module gives a continuous refresh of parking slots to drivers through cellphone application(Future Enhancement) with a specific end goal to guide them and encourage the errand of finding an accessible parking slot. 

The proposed system provides a vision-based approach for detecting vacancies of parking spaces for a given context. 
This approach of the module provides real-time updates of parking spaces to drivers via mobile phone application in order to guide them and facilitate the task of locating an available parking space.
